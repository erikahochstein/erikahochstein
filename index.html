                            While studying abroad, I took Leadership Development in the Tech Sector where I worked with five other students on a challenge project. Our client was a kindergarten and primary school located in Prague, Czech Republic. Over the course of three months, our team researched and generated a technical solution to help our client build strong relationships with their alumni and encourage their alumni to remain involved with the school community long after graduation.
                            <br><br>
                            To strengthen alumni relations, our solution utilized DonorBox, a third-party solution, to increase donations and general support for the school. Prior to discovering this solution, our team coordinated with the school director to learn about their needs. We then researched both independent solutions and third-party solutions to evaluate which platform would best increase alumni engagement while remaining within the school's budget, providing an easy-to-use interface, upholding best practices in data privacy and security, following relevant regulations such as GDPR, the EU general data protection regulation.
                            <br><br>
                            My individual contributions to this project include researching pre-existing marketing solutions and meeting weekly with our challenge project coordinator to update them on our progress, communicate with our client, and discuss project enhancements.

                            As the Technology Chair on the Executive Board of the Michigan Synthetic Biology Team, a student-led organization at the University of Michigan, I oversaw the development of the Team Wiki. The Team Wiki is a website that showcases the club's year-long research project, and it is a required deliverable for the Internationally Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) academic competition that MSBT participates in each year. I led a team of two developers and delgated coding tasks throughout the development process.
                            <br><br>
                            To create the Team Wiki, I coordinated weekly with the Co-Presidents to discuss the content and structure of the website. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the website, and I brought the Figma designs made by our Financial Chair to life. This project required consistent communication with the two developers on my team to ensure completion of the project by the submission deadline, as well as with the executive board of the club to ensure accurate content was being displayed on the site in the desired manner.
                            <br><br>
                            This Wiki contributed to the team's Gold Medal Award at the 2023 iGEM Competition!

                            In addition to the Team Wiki, I designed and developed the club's personal website! The aim of the club's website is to attract new members by providing information about the club, showcase previous and current project work, and streamline the donation process for company and individual sponsors.
                            <br><br>
                            After planning out the design for each page of the site using Figma, I implemented my designs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned how to use the software PuTTY to securely transfer the website files from my computer to U-M's central file storage system to host this website through U-M's Information and Technology Services.
                            <br><br>
                            I utilized a mobile-first design approach to create responsive layouts that prioritize accessibility for all types of users. I highly value <strong>inclusive design</strong> and product creation techniques that <strong>keep accessibility at the forefront</strong> of the design. Thus, I made sure the website complied with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines to ensure that all prospective members and interested sponsors can easily navigate the site.

                            The computer science committee within End the Cycle, a student organization at U-M, is an entirely student-led committee. After U-M changes to the computer science program, requiring students to be selected for the major, we developed a one week, computer programming summer bootcamp for local high school students. This bootcamp aims to help students gain exposure to programming prior to college.

                            As a member of the curriculum team, my four teammates and I created four Python lessons. I specifcally created various diagrams, wrote material for the lessons, and helped structure interactive activities used to complement our lesson material. These various forms of content presentation are used to promote accessibility in our lessons, supporting various modes of learning. In addition to teaching the lessons this August, our team will also be taking the students on tours of U-M's campus, answering their questions and providing mentorship throughout the week, and teaching them how to build a choose-your-own-adventure coding project for their resume!

                            This is the first website I have ever created! In fall of 2022, I decided to expand my technical skillset by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I utilized online resources and tutorials to develop this website for Emma Hochstein, an interior design student at Michigan State University. This website showcases her various academic projects, acting as an online portfolio. This project not only allowed me to expand my technical skills, but I also learned how to communicate with a client to develop a product that meets their needs. I have since taken a course in web design where I have learned more about standard front-end development practices and the importance of designing for and ensuring accessibility in websites.
