Hi! My name is Erika Hochstein. I am a rising junior at the University of Michigan studying computer science. I have experience with front-end web development, and I have an interest in learning more about the development and maintenance of complex software systems. Check out my <a href="https://erikahochstein.github.io/erikahochstein/">personal website> that I designed and coded to learn more about me!
